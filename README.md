## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced image search system that leverages Python and deep learning techniques. The core of the project involves extracting deep features from images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to perform efficient and accurate image retrieval based on visual similarity.

## Key Components
Install necessary libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, sci-kit-learn, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.
Configure the environment to handle large image datasets and perform efficient computations.
Preprocess the Dataset
Load images and apply preprocessing steps.
Save preprocessed images for further use.
Feature Extraction
Load a pre-trained CNN model like Resnet50
Pass each image through the CNN and extract feature vectors.
Store the feature vectors for all images in the dataset.
Implement KNN for Image Retrieval
I used Scikit-learn's KNN implementation to index the feature vectors.
Choose an appropriate value of K(In my case its 5) and a distance metric.
Fit the KNN model with the extracted feature vectors.
Create a function to process the query image, extract its feature vector, and perform the KNN search.
Develop a user interface using Streamlit to input query images and display search results.
Optimize and Evaluate
